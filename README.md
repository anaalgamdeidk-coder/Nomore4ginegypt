About This Protest

This project and the discussions around it are not harmful, not violent, and not intended to disrupt services or public safety.

The goal is simple and reasonable:

Advocate for modern internet infrastructure in Egypt

Push for fair, uncapped, or truly high-limit internet plans

Highlight the need for proper 5G deployment

This is a digital awareness effort, not an attack on institutions, companies, or individuals.

Why 5G Matters in Egypt

Egypt already has millions of users relying on the internet for:

Education

Development and programming

Content creation

Remote work

Online businesses

However:

Internet quotas are extremely limited

Speeds are inconsistent

Latency is high

Heavy throttling is common

5G is not a luxury.
It is a requirement for modern digital economies.

5G enables:

Higher bandwidth without aggressive throttling

Lower latency for gaming, development, and cloud services

Better performance in dense areas

Future technologies (IoT, smart services, real-time apps)

What This Is Not

To be absolutely clear, this protest is NOT:

Illegal

Violent

A call for sabotage

A call to attack ISPs or government systems

A call to bypass laws or security

It is peaceful, informational, and user-focused.

What We Are Asking For

Proper nationwide 5G rollout

Transparent internet policies

Fair usage that matches global standards

An internet environment that supports developers, students, and creators

That’s it
